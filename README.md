# TF2ID
A simple TF2 ID search.

## Purpose
This was originally created to help a specific community search up item's indexes for plugin tests where implementing a better solution (i.e. menus) to get your items would take too long.
Thus this small project / website was born to make searching around for item ids easier.

### Where can I find the website?
You can find the live website here: [tf2id.zeko.club](https://tf2id.zeko.club/)

## Contributing
You can help contribute by making a pull request, making an issue [f]or editing the `ids.json` to include items you want, or just simply starting this repo.
